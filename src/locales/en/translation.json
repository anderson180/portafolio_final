I like, and I am very attracted to the idea of designing and creating pages, every functionality that we can perform on them, immersing myself in the world of web development and always giving my best to go further and further. Also in helping, teaching and directing people so that they know what are the occupational risks that can arise in the workplace. I really like learning everything, playing sports, listening to music and exercising in my free time."
